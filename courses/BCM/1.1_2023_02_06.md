# Cordero - Lesson 1

There won't be any lesson tomorrow afternoon.
There will be a new lesson Friday, the 17th of Feb, 2023, from 15:00 to 18:00.

## Info

- We will start with some R basics, some bioinformatics basics, and the some modelling.
- Ppl familiar with R can just solve the exercises, without having to follow along.
- The exam will be a small report of all these lessons, with perhaps a small input from each of us.

There's a moodle website for this course.

We don't need to install R studio or R as we can use the hosted versions provided by the department. People who have the R/Rstudio combo already in their laptops can just use their local version. I'm User13. I've saved the login info on a `secrets.txt` file that is not committed.

## Covid19

We will analyze covid19 data. There is a `COVID19` package to install, which contains a large dataframe with many variables regarding covid19 infections.

The granularity of the dataset is country-level plus the Grand Princess cruise ship, that was studied in particular.
The data are recorded day-wise.

There are videos on the web for people who do not know R.

Follow the `.pdf` for today's exercises on this dataframe.
