## Lesson 3 - Algorithms, part 2

Recursive algorithms are those that, while running, call *themselves*.
The problem of the tower of Hanoi is the generic problem that can be solved through a recursive algorithm.

Topics covered:
- Recursive algos (Tower of Hanoi, selection sort, fibonacci sequence)
- Procedural algos (Fibonacci sequence)
- Comparison of time efficiency of recursive and procedural algos.
- Big-O notation to describe time efficiency. Common Big-O classes (constant, linear, log, polynomial and exponential algorithms)
- The recursive change problem as an example of an exponential algo
- Dynamic programming (?)
