# Lesson 1 - The 30th of January, 2023

## Introduction
Lecturer: Andràs Horvàth
He's a computer engineer, working in complex systems.

> Remember to start conda with `startconda` before running the code examples.

The course will be focused on using Python and Python packages to solve easy mathematical problems.

The code and examples are in `Lesson_one.ipynb`. The notebook has extra markdown regarding the code/exercise itself.

We wil first take a look at Python, Jupyter, then Limits and asymptotes.
We will move on to Derivatives and Integrals.
Finally, we will cover differential equations and Reaction networks, a practical application of the above.

## Intro to Jupyter

Start the kernel with `jupyter start`. Jupyter renders as web pages, and it should open a tab with the interface. You can then browse around the file systems (FS) and create folders and notebooks. 

> Exercise: Start Jupyter and create a notebook. Give it a name (`1_introduction`) and save it.

`>>> @ 1_introduction.ipynb`
