# Lesson 2 - 2023/01/31

## Topics

We will talk about limits, and how we can computationally predict the limit of functions.
We will first start by trying to predict the limit through algebra, but then move on to actually execute the function and plot its limits.

We will then consider derivatives, and how to calculate the derivatives of various functions.
