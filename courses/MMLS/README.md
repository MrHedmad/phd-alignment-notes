# Mathematical Models for the Life Sciences

These folders are used to store the notes on this course.

I am assuming that we are working in a `conda`-enabled session (see the initial README).

## Setup
To setup, install Jupyter with `conda install jupyter`, then install the packages `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `sympy` with `pip install numpy matplotlib sympy`.

If you installed anaconda (and not miniconda) you can probably skip this step.
